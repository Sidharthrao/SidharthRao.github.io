- Business-friendly descriptions that minimize technical jargon
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Supports both public and private repositories
- Filtering options for forks, archived repos, and more
- Easy to customize and maintain

## Secure Setup Instructions

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to securely fetch your repositories server-side. Your token is stored in GitHub Secrets and never exposed in the public repository.

### 1. Generate GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" > "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub.io Portfolio")
4. Select the `repo` scope (this gives access to private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!

### 2. Add Token to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `IO` (or `GH_PAT_TOKEN` as alternative)
5. Value: Paste your GitHub Personal Access Token
6. Click **Add secret**

**Note**: The workflow will check for `IO` secret first, then `GH_PAT_TOKEN`, then fall back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### 3. Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository **Settings** > **Actions** > **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select:
   - ✅ **Read and write permissions**
   - ✅ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
3. Click **Save**

### 4. Push Files and Trigger Workflow

1. Commit and push all files to your repository
2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run and generate `projects.json`
3. The workflow runs:
   - On every push to `main` branch
   - Daily at midnight UTC (to keep projects updated)
   - Manually via "Run workflow" button in Actions tab

### 5. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder
4. Click **Save**
5. Your site will be available at `https://sidharthrao.github.io` within a few minutes

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/update-projects.yml`):
   - Runs server-side using your secure token from GitHub Secrets
   - Fetches all your repositories from GitHub API
   - Processes and filters the data
   - Generates `projects.json` file
   - Commits the file back to your repository

2. **Frontend** (`index.html` + `script.js`):
   - Loads `projects.json` (generated by GitHub Actions)
   - Renders projects in a beautiful card layout
   - No API calls from the browser - completely secure!

## Local Testing

To test locally using your `.env` file:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
   ```
   IO=your_github_token_here
   ```

2. Run the build script to generate `config.js`:
   ```bash
   node build-config.js
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a browser
4. The page will fetch from GitHub API directly using the token from `.env`

**Important**: 
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed
- The `config.js` file generated by the build script should also not be committed (it contains your token)
- Only the template `config.js` (without token) should be in the repository

## Customization

### Filtering Options

Edit `.github/workflows/update-projects.yml` to change filtering:

```yaml
# In the workflow file, modify these values:
const excludeForks = true;        # Exclude forked repositories
const excludeArchived = true;     # Exclude archived repositories
const excludePrivate = false;      # Set to true to exclude private repos
```

### Styling

Edit `styles.css` to customize:
- Colors (defined in `:root` CSS variables)
- Layout and spacing
- Typography
- Card designs

### Project Display

Edit `.github/workflows/update-projects.yml` to customize:
- How project descriptions are generated
- Date formatting
- Project name formatting
- What data is included in `projects.json`

### HTML Structure

Edit `index.html` to customize:
- Header content and title
- Footer information
- Page metadata

## Troubleshooting

### Projects Not Showing Up

1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
   - Verify the workflow ran successfully
   - Check if `projects.json` was created/updated
   - Look for any error messages

2. **Verify Secrets**: Ensure `IO` (or `GH_PAT_TOKEN`) is set correctly in repository secrets

3. **Check Workflow Permissions**: Ensure Actions have read/write permissions

4. **Browser Console**: Open browser developer tools and check for errors

### Workflow Fails

- **Token Issues**: Verify your token has `repo` scope
- **Permissions**: Check that Actions have write permissions
- **API Rate Limits**: GitHub API has rate limits, but the workflow should handle this

### projects.json Not Updating

- The workflow runs automatically on push and daily
- You can manually trigger it: **Actions** tab > **Update Projects Data** > **Run workflow**

### Local Testing Issues

- If testing locally, ensure `config.js` has your token (temporarily)
- Use a local web server instead of opening `index.html` directly
- Check browser console for CORS or API errors

## Security Notes

- ✅ **Token is secure**: Stored in GitHub Secrets, never in code
- ✅ **No client-side API calls**: All data fetching happens server-side
- ✅ **Safe to make repository public**: No sensitive data exposed
- ✅ **projects.json is safe**: Contains only public project metadata
